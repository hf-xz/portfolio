        <h2>A. Installation - Caper Fire "雀跃之火"</h2>

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In order to increase the immersion of people listening to music, so
          that music for people to bring more pleasant experience, we decided to
          carry out the "Caper Fire" music flame rhythm system project plan. The
          sound acquisition device of the system can collect the ambient sound
          signal or the input sound media signal, and the system controls the
          height of the flame generated in the flame device according to the
          volume and spectrum of the collected sound signal, which increases the
          user's immersion in music. At the same time, led light arrays outside
          the flame unit will display a spectrum map of the visual sound signal
          in real time to optimize the user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Parts of Work</h3>
        <p>
          I'm responsible for coding in this work. I wrote the code to complete
          the following tasks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Drive hardware&nbsp;</b>
            By defining pins, reading and outputting voltage changes, I
            successfully achieved sound information reading from the microphone,
            controlling servo rotation, and controlling LED light changes
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Perform filtering on microphone data collection&nbsp;</b>
            Due to microphone quality issues, there is a lot of noise in the
            collected sound data. I used a filtering algorithm to filter out the
            noise and obtained higher quality sound information
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Perform FFT calculations on sound data&nbsp;</b>
            By performing FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) on sound data, I obtained
            frequency domain data, which I can then discretize and display on
            LED matrix light board
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Processes & Design Thinking</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I took inspiration from the Fire Dragon Scroll and wanted to create
            a device that can control flames
          </li>
          <li>
            I discussed the feasibility with the group members and decided to
            combine this flame control device with sound and melody to form a
            flame atmosphere lighting fixture that provides feedback based on
            environmental sound. The goal is to install it in places such as
            restaurants
          </li>
          <li>
            We collected people's attitudes through distributing survey
            questionnaires and found that everyone agrees with this
          </li>
          <li>
            Under the guidance of our teacher, we created this device through
            methods such as researching materials and conducting experiments
          </li>
        </ol>
